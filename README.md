## About The Project

I am not positioning myself as an asynchronous programming guru; rather, I am new to this business. Therefore, I decided to create a bot that will make simple requests to the server and receive information from them. It will help people find the statistics of different players. In the future, it is planned to expand it to a full-fledged football database with the help of which the user will be able to receive any information about football.

### Built With
* [FootballAPI](https://www.football-data.org/)
* [Fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fetch)
* [TelegramBotAPI](https://core.telegram.org/api)




## Getting Started
In [Telegram](https://web.telegram.org/), you need to find a bot with the @playerstatbot tag and start chatting with it. You will also find instructions for using the bot there.
## Usage
You can use this bot to search for some information about football, namely scorers, tables and matches of the top leagues of Europe.
