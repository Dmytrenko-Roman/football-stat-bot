<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I am not positioning myself as an asynchronous programming guru; rather, I am new to this business. Therefore, I decided to create a bot that will make simple requests to the server and receive information from them. It will help people find the statistics of different players. In the future, it is planned to expand it to a full-fledged football database with the help of which the user will be able to receive any information about football.

### Built With
* [FootballAPI](https://www.football-data.org/)
* [Fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fetch)
* [TelegramBotAPI](https://core.telegram.org/api)
